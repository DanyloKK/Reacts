            <h1 className="container-contacts__title">Contacts are an essential part of communication, whether personal or professional. They refer to
                individuals or organizations that you interact with regularly, whether through phone calls, emails,
                social media, or in person. Keeping track of your contacts is important for maintaining relationships
                and ensuring that you're able to stay in touch when necessary.</h1>
            <p className="container-contacts__paragraph">In today’s digital world, contacts are usually stored in phone directories, email applications, and
                social media platforms. These tools help organize information such as names, phone numbers, email
                addresses, social media profiles, and notes about interactions.</p>
            <p className="container-contacts__paragraph">Effective contact management can help you avoid missing important messages, maintain meaningful
                relationships, and stay organized in both your personal and business life. You can categorize contacts
                into groups, such as family, friends, colleagues, or clients, and even assign priority levels to ensure
                timely follow-ups.

                Whether it’s for networking, reaching out to old friends, or managing professional connections, having a
                clear and updated contact list is a valuable resource.</p>
