            <h2 className="container-about__title">Hello! My name is Danil, and I’m 23 years old. I am currently focused on improving my skills in web
                development, especially in front-end technologies like JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and React. My journey into
                coding started not too long ago, and I’ve been actively learning and practicing various concepts,
                including JavaScript array methods, Promises, and working with the DOM.</h2>
            <p className="container-about__paragraph">In addition to programming, I am passionate about fitness. I aim to increase my bench press strength from
                140 kg to 150 kg within the next six months and continue improving my overall strength. My current
                personal record in the bench press is 140 kg, and my focus is on enhancing my biceps, chest, and
                maintaining a strong physique.</p>
